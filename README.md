# Category Matching and Scoring System

## Overview

This codebase provides a powerful solution for matching and scoring product categories across different classification systems. It's designed to help businesses and organizations streamline their product categorization processes, making it easier to compare and align categories from various sources.

## What Does It Do?

Imagine you have two lists of product categories: one from your company and another from a partner or industry standard. These lists might use different words or structures to describe similar products. Our system helps bridge this gap by:

1. Cleaning and standardizing category names
2. Finding similarities between categories using advanced language processing techniques
3. Scoring how well categories match across different systems
4. Providing a final, best match for each category

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes category names to ensure fair comparisons.
- **Synonym Matching**: Identifies categories that mean the same thing but use different words.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Uses advanced math to measure how similar category descriptions are.
- **Combined Scoring**: Merges different matching techniques to provide the best overall results.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: The system starts by reading two CSV files:
   - Your source categories (e.g., your company's product list)
   - Target categories (e.g., a standard industry classification)

2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Converts all text to lowercase
   - Removes punctuation and common words that don't add meaning
   - Simplifies words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run")

3. **Matching Processes**:
   - **Synonym Matching**: Finds categories that mean the same thing using different words.
   - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures how similar the wording is between categories.

4. **Scoring**: Combines the results from different matching techniques to identify the best matches.

5. **Output**: Provides a list of your source categories with their best matches from the target list, along with confidence scores.

## Who Is It For?

This system is valuable for:
- E-commerce platforms aligning product categories with industry standards
- Retailers integrating product catalogs from multiple suppliers
- Market researchers comparing product classifications across different sources
- Any organization needing to standardize or map between different category systems

## Benefits

- **Time-Saving**: Automates a process that would be extremely time-consuming if done manually.
- **Accuracy**: Uses advanced language processing to catch similarities a human might miss.
- **Flexibility**: Can be adapted to work with various category systems and languages.
- **Insight**: Provides scores to show how confident the system is in each match.

## Getting Started

To use this system, you'll need:
1. Python installed on your computer
2. The required libraries (listed in `pyproject.toml`)
3. Your source and target category lists in CSV format

Detailed setup and usage instructions can be found in the documentation within each module.

## Technical Note

While designed to be powerful, this system does require some technical knowledge to set up and run. If you're not comfortable with Python programming, consider seeking assistance from a developer or data scientist to help implement and customize the system for your specific needs.
